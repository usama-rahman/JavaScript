## Looping Objects Object `Keys`, `Values`, and `Entries`

```js
//  Property Name / Keys

const properties = Object.keys(openingHours);
console.log(properties);

let openStr = `We are open on ${properties.length} Days: `;

for (const day of properties) {
  openStr += `${day}, `;
}
console.log(openStr);

// Property values

const values = Object.values(openingHours);
console.log(values);

// Entries Object

const entries = Object.entries(openingHours);

// [key, Value]

for (const [key, { open, close }] of entries) {
  console.log(`On ${key} we open at ${open} and close at ${close}`);
}
```

## Logical Assignment Operators

```js
const rest1 = {
  name: 'NYC',
  // numGuests: 20,
  numGuests: 0,
};

const rest2 = {
  name: 'LA',
  owner: 'Rossi',
};

// OR (||) assingment operator

// rest1.numGuests = rest1.numGuests || 10;
// rest2.numGuests = rest2.numGuests || 10;

// rest1.numGuests ||= 10;
// rest2.numGuests ||= 10;

// nulliah assingment operator (null or undefined)
rest1.numGuests ??= 10;
rest2.numGuests ??= 10;

console.log(rest1);
console.log(rest2);
```

---

## The Spread Operator`...`

```javascript
const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];
console.log(numbersCombined);

// spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;
console.log(numbers);

// We can use the spread operator with objects too

const myVehicle = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red',
};

const updateMyVehicle = {
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021,
  color: 'yellow',
};

const myUpdatedVehicle = { ...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle };

console.log(myUpdatedVehicle);
```

---

## Short Circuiting`&& and ||`

```js
console.log('---- OR ----');

console.log(undefined || 0 || '' || 'Hello' || 23 || null);
```

---

## The Nullish Coalescing Operator`??`

```js
// Nullish: null and undefined (NOT 0 or '')

let myPoint = null;

const point = myPoint ?? 10;
console.log(point);
```

## Coding Challenge #1

Building a football betting app !

Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game (below). In this challenge we're gonna work with the data. So here are your tasks:

1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')

2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining (10 field players)

3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)

4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'

5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')

6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player names (NOT an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)

7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, WITHOUT using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.

TEST DATA FOR 6: Use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
